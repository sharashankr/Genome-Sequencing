# Detailed Analysis of Code Questions

This document provides a detailed note analyzing each question addressed in the code related to genomic sequence analysis.

## Q1: Edit Distance for Pattern GCTGATCGATCGTACG

- **Objective**: Calculate the edit distance between the pattern "GCTGATCGATCGTACG" and a specific excerpt from human chromosome 1 (from the file `chr1.GRCh38.excerpt.fasta`).
  
- **Edit Distance Definition**: The edit distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another. This is crucial in genomics for comparing DNA sequences, where small mutations can have significant biological implications.
  
- **Code Explanation**: The `editDistance` method of the `findPatternV3` class reads the genome sequence from the file, constructs a dynamic programming matrix, and calculates the edit distance using the provided pattern.
  
- **Result**: The output displays the edit distance, indicating how closely the pattern matches the genomic sequence. A smaller edit distance suggests a closer match.

## Q2: Edit Distance for Pattern GATTTACCAGATTGAG

- **Objective**: Similar to Q1, this question calculates the edit distance for a different pattern, "GATTTACCAGATTGAG," using the same genomic excerpt.
  
- **Importance**: Understanding the edit distance for different patterns is essential in identifying mutations or variations in genetic sequences, which can be critical in research, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.
  
- **Code Functionality**: The same method, `editDistance`, is used for this pattern. The process is identical to Q1, with a different input pattern.
  
- **Result**: The print statement outputs the computed edit distance, providing insight into how well this pattern aligns with the genomic data.

## Q3: Overlap Graph Analysis

- **Objective**: Construct and analyze an overlap graph based on the overlaps found in the previous patterns. Specifically, this question aims to determine how many edges are in the graph, representing distinct pairs of reads that overlap.
  
- **Overlap Graph Concept**: In bioinformatics, overlap graphs are used to visualize relationships between sequences based on overlaps, which can help in genome assembly and identifying similar sequences.
  
- **Code Execution**: The code first constructs the overlap graph using the `naive_overlap_map` method, which pairs reads based on their overlaps. It then calculates the total number of edges by summing the lengths of the edge sets in the graph.
  
- **Result**: The total number of edges is printed, indicating how many distinct pairs of reads have overlapping regions.

## Q4: Outgoing Edges in the Overlap Graph

- **Objective**: This question focuses on the number of nodes (reads) in the overlap graph that have at least one outgoing edge, meaning they overlap with at least one other read.
  
- **Significance**: Understanding the connectivity of reads in an overlap graph is crucial for tasks such as genome assembly, where overlapping sequences are used to construct a continuous representation of the genome.
  
- **Code Implementation**: The code simply counts the number of nodes in the graph. Since each key in the graph represents a read with outgoing edges, the length of the graph directly gives the number of nodes with overlaps.
  
- **Result**: The print statement outputs the total number of nodes with outgoing edges, providing insights into the complexity and interconnectivity of the reads in the dataset.

## Runtime Analysis

- **Performance Measurement**: The code measures the execution time for different parts of the analysis using `time.time()`. This information helps to understand the efficiency of the naive overlap mapping and optimized algorithms.
  
- **Insights on Performance**: By comparing the running times for the naive overlap mapping, phrase reads construction, and optimized graph construction, one can evaluate the trade-offs between different approaches in terms of speed and memory usage.

## Summary

In summary, the code provides a framework for analyzing genetic sequences through edit distance calculations and overlap graph constructions, which are foundational techniques in bioinformatics for understanding genetic relationships and variations.
