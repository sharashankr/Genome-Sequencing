# Importance of Studying Computational Genomics

The importance of studying the intersection of computer science and life sciences is recognized due to the significant advancements in DNA sequencing technology. The rapid decrease in costs and improvements in data delivery have led to widespread utilization of sequencers in various life science fields. Numerous articles can be found discussing innovative applications of sequencing in studying human genomes.

Sequencing is being employed to investigate rare genetic diseases in children, analyze the genomes of ancient humans to understand human origins and migration patterns, explore tumors in cancer patients for improved treatment strategies, and study the multitude of microbes residing in the human gut. Fundamental questions regarding the functionality of DNA within genomes are being addressed as well. 

In contemporary life science and medicine, sequencing is utilized extensively, drawing parallels to the pervasive use of computing technologies. The affordability and effectiveness of sequencing have enabled its application in numerous contexts, some of which may be unexpectedly clever.

The study of computational genomics is vital for understanding the algorithms that underpin these methodologies. Knowledge of these algorithms aids in recognizing their strengths and limitations. Historical efforts, such as those in the late 1990s to sequence the human genome, demonstrated the significance of algorithmic approaches. Two teams adopted different strategies to tackle the de novo shotgun assembly problem, which ultimately led to the successful assembly of the human genome by the team that believed in solving the computational challenges involved.

Understanding existing methodologies is essential for continuous improvement in this dynamic research area. Both academic institutions and industry research labs are actively exploring better methods for analyzing large volumes of DNA sequencing data. Computer scientists and computational experts play crucial roles in every large-scale genomic project, reinforcing the reliance on advanced algorithms developed within the field.

This area of study is identified as a promising frontier for those interested in making contributions. The exploration of algorithms and data structures within computational genomics presents numerous exciting applications. Many algorithms and data structures studied have relevance beyond genomics, extending to fields such as information retrieval and natural language processing, where large quantities of text are routinely managed.
