# Genome-Sequencing
The codebase explores algorithms for analyzing DNA sequencing data, focusing on solving exact and approximate matching problems. It covers the Boyer-Moore algorithm for efficient exact matching, solutions for edit distance, global and local alignment in bio-sequence analysis, and methods for addressing the genome assembly problem.
